      <p>Hi! We are Salvador Avelar, Luis Ramirez, Xiomara Quinonez and Ouyanatu Maina - a group of 2nd year SMASH Stanford scholars. SMASH 
        is a three year residential STEM program for students from underrepresented backgrounds. At SMASH, the project we are working on this
        year focuses on bringing awareness to different environmental issues. Our groups’ topic is the various effects of California’s wildfires,
        both environmentally and health wise. Our goal is to raise awareness about the effects of past wildfires and provide general information
        about wildfires in California.
