      <h3>General information about wildfires</h3>
        <p>Wildfires are fires fueled by weather, wind, and and dry underbrush; wildfires burn acres of land and destroy everything
          in their path. Some wildfires are so extreme that they are able to clear 4 million to 5 million acres of land in the U.S.
          every year. Wildfires are formed through a “fire triangle.” The fire triangle includes fuel, oxygen, and a heat source. 
          Fuel includes any flammable materials, oxygen includes air, and heat includes anything that is able to provide sufficient
          heat to spark a wildfire. Many wildfires can be started by people, while others can be started by dry weather, which includes
          droughts. One of the reasons California had many disastrous wildfires during 2017 was because of the amount of rain that it had.
          All of the rain that California received allowed plants to grow more than usual, which meant that when the summer hit and dried
          up all of the vegetation, there was even more dry brush ready for firestarting.
        </p>

      <h3>What should I do when there is a wildfire?</h3>
        <p>It’s a good idea to have a plan in place incase of a wildfire, just like you do for earthquakes. Since fires are natural disasters 
          that frequently occur in California, check out the <a id="plugca" href="http://www.fire.ca.gov">Califoria Fire website</a>, that provides resources
          and information on evacuation protocols and prevention practices for wildfires. However, things to do if you are under a wildfire warning
          include: leaving your home if you are told to do so, listening to emergency information alerts, and using N95 masks to keep the air out of 
          your breath. Some things you can do ahead of time to prepare for wildfires are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="list">Sign up for your community’s warning system</li>      
            <li class="list">Have an evacuation plan - know evacuation routes and potential shelters</li>      
            <li class="list">Have a plan for pets and livestock as well</li>      
            <li class="list">Gather emergency supplies - N95 respirator masks, medication, food</li>      
            <li class="list">Keep important documents in a fireproof place</li>      
            <li class="list">Find an outdoor water source with a hose that is easily accessible</li>      
            <li class="list">Pay attention to air quality alerts</li>      
          </ul>

      <h3>Why does california have so many wildfires?</h3>
        <p>California is so prone to wildfires because of the extremely strong winds due to the dry and high-pressure air masses 
          from the Great Basin and Mount Diablo. Winds like the Santa Ana and Diablo winds often keep the fires burning as well 
          as spread them across more and more acres of land.
        </p> 

      <h3>What contributes to wildfires?</h3>
        <p>Contrary to their name, most of California's wildfires are actually started by humans. Some human causes of wildfires are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="list">Unattended campfires</li> 
            <li class="list">Discarded Cigarettes</li> 
            <li class="list">Arson</li> 
            <li class="list">Playing with matches or firestarters</li> 
          </ul>
        <p>Some natural starts to wildfires are due to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="list">High speed winds</li>
            <li class="list">Dry vegetation</li>
            <li class="list">Time of day - between 10pm and 1am are peak winds</li>
            <li class="list">Heat from the sun or a lightning strike</li>
          </ul>    

      <h3>What are possible effects of wildfires?</h3>
        <p>Effects of wildfires include injuries and deaths. Many people and animals have experienced injuries and death due to
          contact with wildfire when they are trying to put out or escape from fires. Wildfires can also cause flooding and 
          disrupt communication, power, and transportation among people experiencing the fires. Lastly, wildfires have an effect
          on the environment as wildfires are known to destroy everything they touch. Wildfires can destroy fields and carry lots
          of smoke that harms the rest of the environment and humanity near the fires. 
        </p>
      <h3>Environmental Effects</h3>
        <p>Some environmental effects of wildfires are that they: </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="list">Contribute to climate change because of their production of carbon dioxide</li>
            <li class="list">Release greenhouse gasses</li>
            <li class="list">produce both carbon monoxide and dioxide, which contribute to national and global air pollution due
              to wind</li>
          </ul>
      <h3>Health Effects</h3>
        <p>Some health effects of wildfires are:</p>
          <ul>
          <li class="list">Burns</li>
          <li class="list">lung or respiratory issues due to smoke</li>
          <li class="list">Possibility of carbon monoxide poisoning</li>
          <li class="list">Death</li>    
        </ul>
      
      <h3>What to do to prepare ahead of time:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="list">Sign up for your community's waring system</li>
          <li class="list">Have an evacuation plan - know evacuation routes and potential shelters</li>
          <li class="list">Have a plan for pets and livestock as well</li>
          <li class="list">Gather emergency supplies - N95 respiartor masks, medication, food</li>
          <li class="list">Keep important documents in a fireproof place</li>
          <li class="list">Find an outdoor water source with a hose that is easily accessible</li>
